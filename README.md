# Dead Frontier 1 Mod Menu

A comprehensive mod menu for Dead Frontier 1 with various enhancements for player movement, world interaction, combat gameplay, and visual overlays.

## Features

### Player Mods

- **Infinite Sprint**
  - Removes stamina restrictions and allows your character to sprint endlessly.

- **Speed Multiplier**
  - Set a custom value to increase walking and running speed.

- **Auto Loot Walker** (v1.2+)
  - Automatically walks to nearby loot containers. Features intelligent pathfinding with obstacle avoidance and stuck detection. Waits for you to manually search each loot spot.

- **Fast Loot Search**
  - Looting becomes instant, skipping the normal searching animation.

- **Lazy Loot**
  - Press `;` to pull the nearest loot spot directly to your location. Great for fast looting sessions.

- **Item Filtering** (v1.1+)
  - **Ammo**: Auto Deny
  - **Food/Meds**: Auto Consume
  - **Cash**: Auto Accept
  - **Custom**: Accept items like reactive, ruby, implant / Deny items like katana, nails, k-50m, grinder

### World Mods

- **Visual Clarity**
  - Reduces or removes visual clutter and brightens the game for easier play.

- **Camera FOV**
  - Adjust the field of view to widen or tighten how much of the world you see.

- **Disable Weather** (v1.2+)
  - Removes rain and snow effects for better performance and visual clarity.

### Combat Mods

- **Auto Fire**
  - Toggle autofire with `Ctrl + F` to continuously shoot. Useful for grinding experience.

- **Bandit Begone**
  - Disables all bandits. They are invisible, but still killable if you need to.

- **Forcefield**
  - Generates a ring around you where zombies cannot enter. Customize radius and strength to control how close they can get.

- **Disable Aggro** (v1.2+)
  - Prevents zombies from aggroing on you. They remain visible but won't attack or follow you.

- **Low Exploder Radius**
  - Shrinks explosion damage from fat zombies. Be careful, as this only applies to that specific zombie type.

- **Low Spitter Radius**
  - Reduces spitter range to 0.1m, effectively preventing them from dealing damage.

### HUD Mods (v1.2+)

- **Loot Status**
  - Displays loot count, last processed item, and filtering status at the top of your screen.

- **Radar (Enemies + Loot)**
  - Shows colored markers on the minimap for all nearby enemies (red) and loot containers (yellow).

- **Nearest Loot Arrow**
  - Displays a directional arrow on your HUD pointing to the nearest loot container.

## Disclaimer

**Use at your own risk.** Nothing is completely ban proof, so avoid using your main account. While these mods have been used during development and updates without being banned, I am not responsible for any bans or account issues that may occur.

**Use common sense.** Only activate mods that you are using. Some mods may conflict with each other (e.g., using forcefield + freeze zombies + bandit begone simultaneously), so limit usage if you want to avoid bans.

These mods are created for personal use.
